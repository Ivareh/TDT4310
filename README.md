# `TDT 4310 - Intelligent Text Analytics and Language Understanding`

##  `Welcome 👋`
This is a supplementary space for the exercises/lab and is fully obligatory. However, the solutions to exercises and general tips/tricks will be found here.
Note that the first lab will posted the first week of the course(specifically **january 13**) alongside the regular lecture, without more than an brief introduction. The week after, **january 20 14:15**, the first lab session takes place in [**H3**](https://link.mazemap.com/xm0ZQ2gt), where you will be able to ask questions and get some help 🙋‍♂️. The very first deadline is **january 27**.


To summarize, the labs will be released every second week on Fridays. You thus get an initial week of attempting to work on the lab --> lab session takes place --> you get another week to finish the lab.

## `Curriculum 📚`
This year, the course curriculum is mostly based around the brand new book by *Ekaterina Kochmar* -- Getting Started with Natural Language Processing. For purchasing instructions (+ discount), visit the course page on Blackboard.

Moreover, we'll make use of the NLTK library. As usual, more information can be found on blackboard. The official site for NLTK is [here](https://www.nltk.org/book).


## `Exercises/labs 📝`
We'll use the term **labs** because it's cooler than exercises. Here's the table with an overview of the labs and their deadlines:

`THESE ARE TEMPORARY AND ABSOLUTELY NOT FINAL!`

| Lab | Release date | Deadline | Topic | Libraries | Chapters |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Lab 1 | January 13 | January 27 | Basic text processing. Word vectors, ... | NLTK | 2, 3 |
| Lab 2 | January 27 | February 10 | TODO | SpaCy | 4, 5, 6 |
| Lab 3 | February 10 | February 24 | TODO | Scikit-learn | 7, 8 |
| Lab 4 | February 24 | March 10 | TODO | Gensim | 9, 10 |

From this point on, the focus will be shifted towards your projects. This will involve machine learning and deep learning techniques, building upon the tasks you've completed in the labs.

The level of difficulty will increase over time, as can be seen from the topics. Some of you will definitely feel the need to get more applications of modern state-of-the-art approaches, but note that you're free to explore anything in the project later in the course!

## `Grading 👨‍🏫`
The labs are not graded, but pass/fail. You need to pass all labs to be eligible for the exam. The criteria will be explained further below.

## `Questions and help 🙋‍♂️`
Try to keep questions regarding labs to the lab session. We will also allow for questions on Blackboard. Try to explore the Q&A resources we've published from earlier years first [here](https://github.com/tollefj/TDT4310-spring-2023).

You're likely to encounter some issues regarding programming as well, as this course is meant to be available to a large variety of backgrounds at the university. In general, RTFM :-)
- NLTK has an extensive collection of both explanations and sample usages:
